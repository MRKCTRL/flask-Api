  src="https://placekitten.com/200/300"
  alt='a cute fluffy kitten'
   />

flow content
  typically, text or embedded content(like images or videos)
  most html elements are part of this category

    things like forms are not
    flow content has multiple subcategories

sectioning content
     sectioning - elements for group other elments into collections

  special container elements used for grouping other elements into meaningful collections
     for example, <article>,<article<,<section> or <nav>
  notably, <head>,<main> and <footer> are not considered sectioning content. instead they are flow content


heading
  elements for defining titles of a section
  reserved for the six heading elements, from <h1> to <h6>
  heading elements can only conatin pharasing content


pharasing content
  plain text elements(or elements that become plain text)
  fot the most part, this is text and marlup of that text(such as emphasis elements)
  if it can be inside a sentence, its likely a phrasing content
  it can also contain images, audio, video, and other. those elements become plain text if the revevant resource cant be retrieved

the mozilla developer network
  mozilla(web tech)

section

  the section element is part of a whole

  example: merch and blog

  <section>
  merch
  </section>
  <section>
  blog post

      <h2>02 dec 2023</h2>
      <p>rain</p>
    </article>
    <article class="day-forecast">
      <h2>04 dec 2023</h2>
      <p>periods of sunshine</p>
    </article>
    <article class="day-forecast">
      <h2>05 dec 2023</h2>
      <p>heavy rain</p>
    </article>
  </article>

div
  very generic, so useful for grouping
  mainly used to aid in styling a page

  take a moment to think if you can use something else instead

head
  introductory content
  headers bars with logo and navigation
  you can use header inside section and article, to put the title and other information

  the header can also be used inside other semantic elements such as <article> or <section>. a section header might conatin the sections heading, author, name, etc. <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <nav> can have ther own <header>

 nav
	major navigation blocks in the site
	often inside a header

main
	the main content of the document(what is unique of this page)
	only 1 per page, inside the body

	support for older browser

  <main role="main">
    <!-- main content goes here -->
  </main>

  footer
  social media links
  secondary navigation
  site smallprint
  you can use footer inside articles or sections, but they should be related to the parent element

what are trying to describe?
  html is used to descrtibe the meaing of the page's content
  in other words: the role of a block content in the contect of the whole document
  html is not for describing what a page looks like-like colors, size, shadows, etc

default styles
  your browser applies some default styles to every element
  for example, <b> and <strong> elements will generally be rendered as bold
  but you should avoid using html for visual effect

  <p> this is some <em>loerm ipsum</em> text</p>

  <p> this some <i lang="la"> lorem ipsum</i> text</p>

who are we describing the content for?
  html is for computers to read
  computers turn the html into things the user sees!
  html is also vital for things like screen readers, where good markup can make navigation much easier

use HTML to describe the content. Use CSS to style the output
